# Project Details

## The Dataset and problem statement
After sufficient discussion, the S&P 500 dataset was chosen. It contains approximately 14 years worth of data for every company on the S&P 500. It also contains other data about each company that could be used to create more accurate models (Sector, Employee count, EBITDA, etc.)

The problem we are trying to answer with this dataset is this:
**Is there a way to predict a single company's stock value based off previous performance? If so, what data can provide the most accurate prediction?**

## Initial Approach
After downloading the dataset that covers the past 14 years of S&P 500 data, each member picked a single stock and attempted to analyze it in their own way. It was agreed that while using a regression analysis was mandatory, other models could be used afterwards to provide additional or more accurate data, if the team member wished. Afterward, the best looking model was chosen for this report.

# Conclusion
<< TODO: please submit your ideas on this, otherwise we'll just end up going with Olha's notebook and I'll write up a quick summary based off her work>>

# Videos
Below are the list of videos from each team member. They discuss her/his experiences with the project, what they've learned, and any other information they feel is useful.
